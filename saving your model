/*You should save every model you experiment with, so you can come back easily to any model you want. Make sure you save
* both the hyperparameters and the trained parameters, as well as the cross-validation scores and perhaps the actual predictions as
* well. This will allow you to easily compare scores across model types, and compare the types of errors they make. You can
* easily save Scikit-Learn models by using Pythonâ€™s pickle module, or using sklearn.externals.joblib, which is more efficient
* at serializing large NumPy arrays:

from sklearn.externals import joblib
joblib.dump(my_model, "my_model.pkl")
# and later...
my_model_loaded = joblib.load("my_model.pkl")
